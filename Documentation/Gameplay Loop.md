# Gameplay Loop

## Game Start
The player enters the level, recieving a single military unit and a single worker. These units spawn alongside the player's base structure, which they must protect.

## The Meat of It
The player explores the cave system, digging out walls, gathering energy from veins of cave moss, and pushing back the waves of enemies to gain control of more territory. To defeat the enemies, the player has access to combat units, and defensive structures, which can prevent enemies from breaching positions while the player's combat units are away. The energy the player harvests will provide the player will additional workers, combat units, and structures.

## Victory
The player achieves victory when they gather a certain amount of energy. The required amount and their progress towards this amount will be clearly visible to the player at every point of the game.

## Defeat
The player will be defeated if the enemy manages to destroy the player's base structure (name for the structure not chosen yet) before the player is able to obtain enough energy.
