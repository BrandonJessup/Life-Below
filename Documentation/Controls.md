# Controls

# Combat Units
Similar to most RTS games, the player will have access to basic controls such as drag-selection, and right-clicking which will instruct any selected combat units to either move to that location or attack the targeted enemy.

# Worker Units
Worker units cannot be controlled directly by the player like combat units can, but instead are controlled by giving orders general orders such as "dig out this area", "harvest these corpses", or "mutate into structure" where workers will then automatically move to the designated locations and carry out those tasks. No worker is ever selected directly during this process, and workers cannot be given commands directly.
